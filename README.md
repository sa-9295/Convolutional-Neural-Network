# Convolutional-Neural-Network

A Practice section from course on Udemy where we will use Convolutional Neural Network to identify and classify images as an image og a cat or of a dog.

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.
